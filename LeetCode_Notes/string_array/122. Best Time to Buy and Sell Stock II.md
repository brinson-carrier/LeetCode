You are given an integer array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold **at most one** share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the **same day**.

Find and return _the **maximum** profit you can achieve_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
**Output:** 7
**Explanation:** Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
Total profit is 4 + 3 = 7.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Total profit is 4.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** There is no way to make a positive profit, so we never buy the stock to achieve the maximum profit of 0.

How I solved:
	Create a int variable for the profit initialized to 0. 
	Create a for loop starting at the first index of the prices array through to the end.
	Since their is no limitation to how much or when one can buy and/or sell then the profit will be the equal to the profit gained when every days gain is considered and all loss is ignored. So, if the prices of index [i] are greater than the price of index [i - 1] then that difference is added to profit.
	Return profit.
