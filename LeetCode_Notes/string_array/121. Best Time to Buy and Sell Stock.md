You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day** to buy one stock and choosing a **different day in the future** to sell that stock.

Return _the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction_. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.

How I solved:
	Create 3 int variables, one for lowest price called low initialized to prices[0], one for best_price initialized to 0, and one for sell initialized to 0.
	Create a for loop for each value `i` in prices.
	if i is less than low reassign low to i.
	Set sell equal to i - low
	if sell is greater than best_sell set best_sell equal to sell
	exit the for loop
	return best_sell
