You are given a **0-indexed** array of integers `nums` of length `n`. You are initially positioned at `nums[0]`.

Each element `nums[i]` represents the maximum length of a forward jump from index `i`. In other words, if you are at `nums[i]`, you can jump to any `nums[i + j]` where:

- `0 <= j <= nums[i]` and
- `i + j < n`

Return _the minimum number of jumps to reach_ `nums[n - 1]`. The test cases are generated such that you can reach `nums[n - 1]`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2. Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [2,3,0,1,4]
**Output:** 2

How I solved:
	Create 3 int variables one for the current Index `currentIndex` initialized to 0, one for the next index initialized to 0, `nextIndex` and one for the number of jumps `jumps` initialized to 0.
	Create a for loop iterating through `nums` via `i` stopping one short because the value of the last entry into the array is irrelevant.
	Set `nextIndex` equal to the greater of itself or the current index plus the value `nums`[i].
	If the value of `nextIndex` is large enough to reach the last index in the array `(nums.length - 1)` return the value of `jumps + 1`. 
	if `i` is equal to `currentIndex` then the jump range has been iterated through meaning a jump to the farthest range is now represented by incrementing `jumps` and setting `currentIndex` equal to `nextINdex`.
	after the for loop return `jumps`.
