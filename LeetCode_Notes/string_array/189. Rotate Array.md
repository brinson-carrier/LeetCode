Given an integer array `nums`, rotate the array to the right by `k` steps, where `k` is non-negative.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
**Output:** [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
**Explanation:**
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2
**Output:** [3,99,-1,-100]
**Explanation:** 
rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]

How I solved:
	Double for loop is no good. It works logically but times out and their is a better way.
	Reverse the entire array.
	Reverse the front and back of the array separately with the front and back being separated by k.
	make sure k is good to go by doing k = k % nums.length to make sure that k isn't bigger than the array. Plus if k == 0 after that then just return the array because it wouldn't change anyway.
	Using a temp int variable rotate the array around entirely, then just the front, then the back.
